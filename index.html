    <h1>Electric Vehicle Population</h1>
    <p>Collaborators: Brian Mach, Nathan Ong</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The main goal of this project is to guide you through the comprehensive pipeline of data science. The pipeline goes from Data Collection, Data Processing, Exploratory Analysis and Data Visualization, Model: Analysis, Hypothesis, and Machine Learning (ML), and Interpretation: Insight and Policy Decision. With this pipeline, we will be specifically focusing on the field of electric vehicles (EVs). As the concerns of the environment continue to grow and the shift towards sustainable energy gains momentum, electric vehicles have been a very popular choice for reducing carbon emissions. With this in mind, we will do a deep dive into data provided by Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) which details the population of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered in the state. 
    </p>

    <p>
        So why is this important? This growth in electric vehicle adoption is not just a measure of technological advancement but it is also an indicator of shifting consumer preferences and policy effectiveness in addressing climate change. We can uncover patterns in EV adoption across different regions and time periods by analyzing the dataset. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Through this tutorial, we will explore various data science techniques to parse, manage, and analyze this dataset and we aim to provide actionable insights on the current state and potential future of electric vehicle usage in Washington State. By focusing on this part of sustainability, we also hope to contribute to the broader conversation on environmental policy and sustainable development.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is the Data Science Lifecycle:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Data Collection</li>
        <li>Data Processing</li>
        <li>Exploratory Analysis & Data Visualization</li>
        <li>Model: Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, & ML</li>
        <li>Interpretation: Insight & Policy Decision</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        The first part of the data science lifecycle is data collection. In our project, we focused on gathering relevant information about the population of electric vehicles. We obtained our primary dataset, “Electruc_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv,” from the Department of Licensing (DOL) in Washington State and this dataset provides us comprehensive details on electric vehicles, including their make, model, electric range, and many other attributes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        During this project, we will use Python as our primary language and Jupiter Notebook to develop this project. To learn more about Jupiter notebooks, click here to read about it. We will also be using the following imports. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
        # These are the standard Data Science Python Libraries
        import numpy as np
        import pandas as pd
        import sklearn
        from sklearn import linear_model

        # These are the HTTP requests of Web Pages from Python Libraries 
        import requests
        from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

        # Dictionary Module
        from collections import defaultdict

        # Python Libraries for graphing/visuals
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import statsmodels.api
        import statsmodels.formula.api as sm
        import seaborn
        import folium
    </code></pre>


    <p>
        We will also be using these two important libraries: Pandas and NumPy. Pandas is a tool that allows us to manipulate data easily and it allows us to transform data easily because of its extensive array of tools. NumPy is able to perform computations on large datasets and it offers an efficient way to store and manipulate information. 
    </p>

    <h2>Data Processing</h2>
    <p>
        The second part of the Data Science Lifecycle is Data Processing, where we will perform actions with our data. First, we will load the dataset using the pandas library and read the contents of the CSV file into a DataFrame for further processing.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">
        # Load our csv file, Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv
        file_path = 'Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv'
        data_of_ev = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        Data can oftentimes become very messy so we need to clean up the data. One example of data being messy is the fact that there can be missing values in the dataset. We can handle the missing values by dropping rows that contain missing values. 
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">
        # Rows with missing values will be dropped
        data_of_ev_cleaned = data_of_ev.dropna()
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        For columns that must be integers, such as ‘Model Year’, we should ensure that column is properly converted into an integer.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">
        # Model Year is a column that should be converted into an integer
        data_of_ev_cleaned['Model Year'] = data_of_ev_cleaned['Model Year'].astype(int)
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        Once we clean the data, we will store this into a new csv file so that we can access a csv file with cleaned data. With clean data, we can perform various analyses in order to gain insights into the electric vehicle population. 
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">
        # With this newly cleaned data, we can store it into a new csv file to use later
        data_of_ev_cleaned.to_csv('Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data_Cleaned.csv', index=False)
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        One way we can perform an analysis is to generate summary statistics for the numerical columns in the dataset. This will give us an overview of the data. We can also count the number of vehicles by make in order to see which manufacturers have the most vehicles registered. Another analysis that we can do is counting the number of vehicles for each type of electric vehicle, such as Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV). Finally, we can calculate the average electric range for each vehicle make. We do this in order to understand which manufacturers produce vehicles with longer ranges.  
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">
        # Now we can get a summary of the statistics
        summary_of_stats = data_of_ev_cleaned.describe()

        # Counting the number of vehicles based on Make
        make_counts = data_of_ev_cleaned['Make'].value_counts()

        # This is the number of vehicles for each type of electric vehicle
        ev_type_counts = data_of_ev_cleaned['Electric Vehicle Type'].value_counts()

        # This is the average range by Make
        avg_range_by_make = data_of_ev_cleaned.groupby('Make')['Electric Range'].mean()

        # Here are the results
        (summary_of_stats, make_counts, ev_type_counts, avg_range_by_make)
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        Here are the results.

    <h2>Exploratory Analysis & Data Visualization</h2>
    <p>
        The third part of the Data Science Lifecycle is Visualizing Data and Analysis. When you are dealing with data, sometimes it is not helpful to just look at columns and rows of data. It helps a lot when you can see a good visual of the data, so let us do that.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the code below, we are able to graph the number of electric vehicles by their make and it provides us a clear view of which manufacturers have the most vehicles registered in the dataset. By analyzing it, we can see that Tesla leads by a significant margin, followed by Nissan, Chevrolet, and Ford, which indicates Tesla’s dominance in the electric vehicle market within the dataset. 
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">
        # Plotting the number of vehicles by Make
        plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
        seaborn.barplot(x=make_counts.index, y=make_counts.values)
        plt.xticks(rotation=90)
        plt.xlabel('Make')
        plt.ylabel('Number of Vehicles')
        plt.title('Number of Vehicles by Make')
        plt.show()
    </code></pre>
    <img src="Num_Vehicles_By_Make.png" alt="Number of Vehicles by Make">

    <p>
        This pie chart below shows the distribution of different types of electric vehicles in the dataset, specifically Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV). By looking at this, we can see that the majority of vehicles are BEVs with a 78.3% majority, while PHEVs make up the remaining 21.7%.  This indicates a strong market trend towards zero-emission vehicles, which aids in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
        # Plotting the distribution of electric vehicle types
        plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
        ev_type_counts.plot(kind='pie', autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140, colors=['#ff9999','#66b3ff'])
        plt.ylabel('')
        plt.title('Distribution of Electric Vehicle Types')
        plt.show()
    </code></pre>
    <img src="Distribution_of_Electric_Vehicle_Types.png" alt="Number of Vehicles by Make">

    <p>
        Finally, the bar chart below shows us the average electric range for each vehicle make and it is a critical factor for consumers that are considering buying electric vehicles. Jaguar has the highest average electric range and it is followed by Tesla and other manufacturers. It is important to understand these variations because it highlights the performance capabilities of different EV brands and as a result, brings guidance to consumer choices and influences market competition. 
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
        # Plotting the average electric range by Make
        plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))

        plt.xticks(rotation=90)
        plt.xlabel('Make')
        plt.ylabel('Average Electric Range (miles)')
